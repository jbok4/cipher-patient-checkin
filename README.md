## Cipher Patient Check-in App
Patients should use this app as their sign-in sheet for the Dr's office. Upon entering they sign in, or sign up if a new user and choose their Dr. At which point they are added to that Dr's "To be seen" list. An Admin user has the authority to mark each patient as "Seen by the Dr" upon being called into the examination rooms. Once Seen by the Dr, the patients names are moved to the "Patients List" which keeps a tally of all the patients seen.
